This PHP file opens a connection to the database on myPHP admin. You must have it installed on your computer,
running, with the Apache server also running. You should edit your mysql.info file to have no password or else
you will not be able to connect to the database. This will insert whatever information you change the variables 
listed in the PHP code into the database. I'm still working on the select statements.

Keep in mind that the location for the PHP_database_connection file must be in /XAMP/htdocs

Replace XAMP with whatever server you're running.
